Two men, Frank and Geoff, were walking along Bold Street when they suddenly found themselves in what appeared to be the 1950s\u2014complete with vintage storefronts, cars, and people in period clothing. One of them even claimed to walk into an old-fashioned shop and interact with people before snapping back to present day. What\u2019s wild is that later investigation showed the shop he thought he entered (Debenhams) used to actually be a clothing store in that exact location during the 1950s. He even described the interior in stunning detail.\n\nJust like your experience, there was no portal or beam of light\u2014just a subtle but inexplicable moment where the rules of time and space didn\u2019t seem to apply. The fact that you recognized one of the people as your dad\u2019s younger self and only confirmed it later through photo hits the same eerie note.\n\nMaybe these glitches are less full-on time travel and more like overlaps in the simulation\u2014brief moments where time folds or data crosswires. Emotionally charged memories or locations can also act like magnets for these phenomena.\n\nReports like yours make an intriguing case. Thanks for sharing. Very cool.",

I'd gone outside at 11pm. A show was on TV streaming, 20 minute episodes, no ads, a series I've seen countless times before.  So when I got back inside, the next episode was just starting, which aligned with my approximate 20 minute estimate of time outside.  But all the clocks (analog, digital, battery run, as well as plugged in, every clock, even my cell phone), suddenly showed it was past 1pm. Over 2 hours had gone by. But only the one 20 minute show had played on TV. My kids were inside and confirmed the TV never paused or shut off the show. So somehow over 2 hours had passed, while I smoked one cigarette and while only one 20 minute TV show had played.  I'd even told the kids before i went out, that it was 11pm, getting late, they'd have to go to bed when I got back in. None of us could figure out how over 2 hours has gone by. I'd normally NEVER let my kids stay up past 1am, even on summer non-school nights. I'd forgotten about it till I just read your post. Spooky stuff..."
