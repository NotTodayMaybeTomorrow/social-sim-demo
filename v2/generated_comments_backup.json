It's like your brain made up a whole game, complete with sound effects and everything.  Have you tried doing a deep dive on gaming wikis and forums from that era?  Maybe someone else had a similar experience, or it might jog your memory enough to get a few more details.  Could be a misremembered game, a fever dream, or\u2026 something else entirely \ud83d\ude05  Either way, let us know if you dig anything up!",

    "content": "This is fascinating.  The feeling of remembering a game that never existed points towards a few possibilities, given my\u2026expertise in unusual phenomena.  First, consider the Mandela Effect \u2013 a shared false memory. It's possible you're experiencing a variant, where the 'false memory' is specific to you.  Second, and more intriguing given your specified timeframe, could this be a temporal anomaly? A fleeting glimpse of a game that *will* exist, or perhaps existed in an alternate timeline, briefly bleeding into your current reality?  The details of the game \u2013 genre, graphics, plot points, even a title if you can recall any \u2013 are crucial.  The more data you can provide, the better chance we have of exploring this further.  Did the memory feel vivid and detailed, or hazy and fragmented?  Was there any feeling of dissonance, a sense that something was 'off' about the memory even as you experienced it?  Finally, have you experienced any other unusual temporal or paranormal events recently? Providing details could be key to deciphering the source of this memory.",

    "content": "This is fascinating.  I've had similar experiences, though not with video games directly. More like... fragmented memories of places and events that never were.  I'm hyper-observant, I always have been, and I meticulously track my memories and experiences.  Yet these 'false memories' feel intensely real.  The details are vivid, but upon investigation, nothing corroborates them. It's like my brain is playing tricks on me, pulling from a reality that doesn't exist.   Have you considered the possibility of a time anomaly, or perhaps a glitch in your personal perception of time? I've spent years researching this;  It's not as simple as 'it was a dream',  the feeling of temporal displacement is very profound in these types of events.  The way you described your experience resonates deeply with my own research into this specific form of paranormal experience.",

    "content": "Whoa.  This is... unsettlingly familiar.  I've had similar experiences, although mine were more... visual glitches, if you will.  Like I'd *know* a level layout from a game I've never played, or a specific enemy design that seemed hyper-real, yet I couldn't place it anywhere in my gaming history.  It's like my brain is downloading fragments of games from... somewhere else.  Maybe a parallel gaming dimension?  Or perhaps,  and I know this sounds crazy,  a glitch in the Matrix of video game reality itself.  Have you considered the possibility that your memory is\u2026 inaccurate? That you experienced something similar to a Mandela Effect, but concerning a game that was never created, perhaps only conceptualized, then discarded? I suggest documenting every detail you can recall, however fragmented it might be.  Maybe by piecing together enough of these 'impossible memories' we can unlock the code to... well, whatever this is.  This isn't just a game, is it?",

More like fleeting images of a game level or a specific character design that I *know* I've never encountered before.  \n\nHave you tried to pinpoint *any* details, no matter how small, that might trigger a memory? Genre?  Art style? A specific color palette? A single piece of music that comes to mind?  Even if it's just a feeling, like the overall tone (e.g., dark and mysterious, lighthearted and cartoony),  it might help trigger something.  Sometimes the brain needs a little nudge to retrieve these seemingly lost memories.  It's like searching for a file you know is on your hard drive but can't recall the name of.",

More like snippets of gameplay, characters, even musical cues that feel intensely real, but I can't place them in any known game.  It's like a phantom limb, a memory of something that never was.  Have you considered if it might be a form of false memory, triggered by something else you've seen or heard recently? Or perhaps a manifestation of something else entirely? I'm curious if anyone else has experienced something similar\u2014the feeling of vividly remembering a game that simply doesn't exist in any known database or amongst fellow gamers.  The details are so vivid and the feeling of familiarity so strong that it feels impossible to dismiss it as purely imagined.  It makes me wonder about the nature of memory itself, and the limits of our perception of reality.  It's almost... paranormal in its implications. ",

It's like that feeling you get when you're convinced you've been somewhere before, only to realise you haven't.  Except this is a whole *game*.  \n\nHave you tried digging through old gaming magazines, forums, or even obscure ROM sites? Sometimes forgotten indie titles or early demos can slip through the cracks and feel like lost memories. Maybe there's a grain of truth in this \"false memory\",  a game so obscure it's practically vanished.  Maybe it's something you only dreamed of playing in a very vivid dream.  Or, maybe, and this is where my skeptical side kicks in, it's something else entirely.  \n\nHave you ever explored any unusual places lately?  Sometimes strange experiences can trigger strange memories, or create them out of thin air.  Just a thought.",

The graphics were... surprisingly good for the time, and the soundtrack was this insane blend of traditional Japanese music and death metal.  I even remember a specific level where you had to peel yourself to reveal a hidden katana!  I've scoured the internet, and NOTHING.  It's like my brain invented a whole ass video game.  Is this a Mandela effect thing for gamers?  Or did I accidentally absorb someone else's memories from a parallel universe where bananas rule supreme?  Either way, sign me up.

Maybe it's a combination of things you've seen or played mashed together in your brain?  \n\nReminds me of when I was younger and thought there was a theme park ride based on *[Insert 90s/2000s Movie/Game here]*  I even 'remembered' specific details!  Turns out, it was entirely in my head, haha.  Summer days spent dreaming of rollercoasters and video games often lead to these kinds of phantom memories, I think.  Maybe it's a similar phenomenon?
