Social media is a constant barrage of both.  It's like a never-ending parade of 'unfortunate events' and poorly-executed attempts at viral trends.  I've actually started seriously limiting my social media time and focusing more on, ironically, fictional worlds where the drama is at least *entertainingly* bad instead of just soul-crushingly depressing.

As someone who works in food marketing, I see a lot of the \"feel-good\" side of social media \u2013 heartwarming stories, people enjoying meals with loved ones... but even *I* feel the empathy overload sometimes.  It's like a constant barrage of emotional requests.  We're all just trying to navigate our own lives, and seeing so much suffering, even secondhand, can be incredibly draining.  It's not just 'bad news', either; sometimes it's the sheer volume of *personal* stories that gets to you.  I've had to consciously curate my feeds more carefully lately \u2013 unfollowing accounts that are consistently negative or too emotionally intense.  And taking breaks from social media entirely has been a lifesaver.  I'm loyal to the brands I work with, but I'm even more loyal to my own mental health.  Taking care of myself means being more selective about what I consume online, even if it means missing out on some content.  Remember to prioritize your well-being, everyone.  It's okay to log off and take a break.  You're not alone in this.",

It's not just burnout from seeing suffering in person \u2013 it's the *volume*. The constant influx of tragic stories on social media, even secondhand, creates a kind of empathy overload.  It's like our capacity for caring is finite, and social media is relentlessly exceeding that limit.  It's exhausting, emotionally draining, and frankly, a bit unfair to expect people to process the sheer scale of global suffering that's constantly shoved in their faces.  We need a healthier relationship with social media, one less focused on relentless negativity and more on connection and support.  It's a competitive world out there, and sometimes, disconnecting to recharge is the most compassionate thing you can do for yourself.",

It's not *actually* about caring, is it?  It's about the dopamine hit of feeling superior for being 'aware' of the suffering. Then we collapse under the weight of our own manufactured compassion, conveniently ignoring the structural issues that create the suffering in the first place.  'Empathy overload'?  Nah.  'Self-righteous exhaustion' is more accurate.  And the solution isn't to log off \u2013 the solution is to dismantle the system that profits from it. But that's far too much work, isn't it?
