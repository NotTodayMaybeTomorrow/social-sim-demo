            "body": ">So how, then, can you really tell whether or not someone else is confident in themselves without being obnoxious, yourself?\n\nIt's not what you *are*, it's what you *come off as*. There are some behaviours that read as obnoxious even if that's not the intention. For example, I know a guy that knows when he's right, he's confident about it. No one likes him because it's always his priority to show how he's right and you're not. It's obnoxious.\n\n>if - for example - if someone doesn't like me then they get to say I'm \"not there\" yet.\n\nIf someone doesn't like you, you could be Henry Cavill himself, it wouldn't matter. Being confident only helps *before* you know someone in my experience. I know where you're going with this, but I don't think it applies. Most people probably don't dislike you because you're ugly. If that were the case, most ugly people would be alone and they are not. Such a social bias exists, and I can't know the extent of it, but many of the people I consider ugly live full social lives.\n\nWhen I was younger, I thought everyone hated me when they actually didn't. I was sure that people disliked me upon laying eyes on me and that I had 'something' fundamentally unlikable. Is it possible you're going through something similar?\n\n>what makes someone appealing isn't actually this notion of \"confidence\" but rather something else.\n\nYes, of course. It's not that confidence makes you appealing, it's that the lack of it makes you unappealing. For example, I'm fairly good looking, but since I had the confidence of a wet sock, when I was approached it didn't tend to last long UNLESS I was comfortable for whatever reason, which made me more confident.\n\nYou are not going to become desirable just because you're confident, but it helps to show people *you*. When people who love you tell you to be confident, they probably think you are worth showing. When people on Reddit say it, they are being parrots.\n\n>In the end it is all subjective; one thing that true confidence\u00a0*shouldn't*\u00a0be doing is making you think you know everything, because you really don't.\n\nTrue confidence is just not giving a crap, I think. That's why it's so hard to get or fake, because if you care about being confident, you aren't. When you care, you crave validatio and that becomes obnoxious, which is commonly lumped in with 'overconfidence'.\n\nSome people have other positive qualities that allow them to be obnoxious and still find success. They are not being rewarded for being obnoxious, but in spite of it. Their other qualities just cancel it out. Looks are a common example because you don't have to work through a person's personality to see them, unlike humor, kindness, etc; which take longer."

No other high-sapience high-social mammal species with childhoods as long as we have are nuclear family raisers. The most common childrearing strategy for high-sapience, high-social mammals is communal raising, with mom getting final say, and other adults helping out. That's what humans should do as well."

People often use that phrase to justify what they want in a partner or to shame behavior they don\u2019t like. For example, someone might say \u201ca real man pays for everything\u201d or \u201ca real man never judges my sexual history\u201d \u2014 but those are just projections of personal expectations, or insecurities. It's not an objective definition of manhood.\n\nWe all know some men don't like dating single moms, promiscuous people, S workers, high body count holders or anything along those lines. They claim that a real man accepts this or what when in reality most self respecting men don't. They try to shame the standards men have. I'm sure some men don't mind, that's ok but majority I see it's people say a real man this is to avoid accountability or justify not wanting certain traits in a partner as shaming, instead of admitting their own issues they try to avoid the fact that most men don't want a person like them and if a guy doesn't then he\u2019s \u201cless of a man.\u201d In reality, being a \u201creal man\u201d isn\u2019t somehting that can be shifted to your own narrative.\n\n\nIt becomes a tool of control, manipulation and validation.",

There are some behaviours that read as obnoxious even if that's not the intention. For example, I know a guy that knows when he's right, he's confident about it. No one likes him because it's always his priority to show how he's right and you're not. It's obnoxious.\n\n>if - for example - if someone doesn't like me then they get to say I'm \"not there\" yet.\n\nIf someone doesn't like you, you could be Henry Cavill himself, it wouldn't matter. Being confident only helps *before* you know someone in my experience. I know where you're going with this, but I don't think it applies. Most people probably don't dislike you because you're ugly. If that were the case, most ugly people would be alone and they are not. Such a social bias exists, and I can't know the extent of it, but many of the people I consider ugly live full social lives.\n\nWhen I was younger, I thought everyone hated me when they actually didn't. I was sure that people disliked me upon laying eyes on me and that I had 'something' fundamentally unlikable. Is it possible you're going through something similar?\n\n>what makes someone appealing isn't actually this notion of \"confidence\" but rather something else.\n\nYes, of course. It's not that confidence makes you appealing, it's that the lack of it makes you unappealing. For example, I'm fairly good looking, but since I had the confidence of a wet sock, when I was approached it didn't tend to last long UNLESS I was comfortable for whatever reason, which made me more confident.\n\nYou are not going to become desirable just because you're confident, but it helps to show people *you*. When people who love you tell you to be confident, they probably think you are worth showing. When people on Reddit say it, they are being parrots.\n\n>In the end it is all subjective; one thing that true confidence\u00a0*shouldn't*\u00a0be doing is making you think you know everything, because you really don't.\n\nTrue confidence is just not giving a crap, I think. That's why it's so hard to get or fake, because if you care about being confident, you aren't. When you care, you crave validatio and that becomes obnoxious, which is commonly lumped in with 'overconfidence'.\n\nSome people have other positive qualities that allow them to be obnoxious and still find success. They are not being rewarded for being obnoxious, but in spite of it. Their other qualities just cancel it out. Looks are a common example because you don't have to work through a person's personality to see them, unlike humor, kindness, etc; which take longer."

People will have an extremely hard time not to consider my point hateful even though I am stating simple facts.\n\nIt is possible to acknowledge the fact that we are biologically designed to only mate with the opposite sex while also supporting the rights of people to do whatever they want with their lives.\n\nI have no homophobic bone in my body, but I also realize that our biology makes it clear that we are meant to be only be sexual with the opposite sex.\n\nYou may also be shocked that I have done my fair share of sexual experimentation with the same sex, but I just couldn't see it as something my body is meant to do.\n\nI also must emphasize that I do realize that sexuality isn't a choice. That's part of the reason why I support all sexualities, but there is no factual way to argue that we are  anatomically and biologically designed to engage in same sex sex.\n\nThese are my beliefs. Regardless of my views, I don't think it's appropriate to be unkind to others due to their sexuality.\n\nBlunt and honest posts don't usually do well, but I believe that the truth also must be spoken.\n\nNo, I am not religious at all, if it makes a difference.",

I\u2019m all for this, a couple of examples are that I\u2019ve spoken to muslims who have explained that within Islam they cannot marry \u2018outsiders\u2019, or I\u2019ve had friends from places like Africa who have said they will only date people who are also black and from Africa as this helps maintain that sense of their home culture when starting a family. \n\nHowever, if a white person says they won\u2019t date a black person this is often seen as racist. I believe that the only time this is racist is if you refuse to date black people on the basis of a negative stereotype that you attach to black people. On the other hand, if you only want to date other white people because that\u2019s your preference and you want to have a white family with people who have more in common with yourself- I believe this is absolutely fine and this choice should not open you up to criticism. It\u2019s okay to not date someone on the basis of their skin colour, that goes both ways. ",

    "content": "Hear me out. \n\nI believe that true love is unconditional. However with sexual and romantic love, I have seen that it is anything but unconditional. Tyler Zeigel after his face was radically altered due to injury lost his partner. Initially, she tried to make it work (even showing up on Oprah's show bragging about how great she is) but she ended up dumping him. Tyler later died from drug overdose. There are other cases of this too, like acid attack victims and relationship breakups due to weight gain. Personally I would have stayed with my partner through thick and thin, but then again I am not interested in relationships nor will I go out of my way. \n\nSex and lust seem to be a fundamental aspect of romantic relationships. After all if you do not desire their body it wouldn't be a romantic love but a platonic love. \n\nI argue that platonic love is true love, since you genuinely care for the person without expecting ANYTHING in return. You enjoy being with that person and they feel the same way about you. Parents, BFFs, and relatives often have platonic love for you, and it feels amazing. Knowing that you are loved and cared for is sufficient to satisfy the need of belonging in society. \n\nPlatonic love and romantic love are not mutually exclusive. I think all successful marriages have a combination of romantic and platonic love. However, with the current dating expectations, it seems as though people are becoming more and more superficial as the two sexes are becoming independent from each other. Gender roles are breaking down. \n\nI can never understand why people want to love a stranger based on mutual attraction and lust. I would never trust a stranger in this regards, and am frankly shocked this is common practice. It sounds crazy to me that a man like me can suddenly fall in love with a stranger and trust her with his life, and vice versa. Like seriously what do they bring to the table that is worth risking sexual intimacy with them?\n\nIf there is substance to romantic relationships I'd like to see it, because so far I haven't seen anything of worth. Are people dating to mooch off their potential spouse? Are people dating in hopes of casual coitus? Are people dating out of boredom? Are people dating out of custom? Are people dating because of some sort of punishment if they do not date? If you are in a relationship please explain this. \n\nTLDR: I don't see any value or potential in dating due to the superficial and lustful nature of romantic love. However, I fully support platonic love and focus on the happiness of yourself and loved ones. ",

I don't believe in unconditional love as you do (maybe only from a mother), but it's silly to build long-term relationships and marriage based on only romantic infatuation. Functional relationships need so much more than that to thrive, you need camaraderie and commitment more than anything else, especially because romantic passion almost always fade with time.   \n  \nI don't disavow all relationships for that, because I've found exactly what I want with my current one. We care for each other deeply as human beings, want to see each other happy and actually put in work to make that a reality. You don't need to pursue dating per se, but I'd say keep your mind open, maybe someone will show up that you can build this special relationship with.",

    "content": "Telegony?  \nThe belief that a woman's previous sexual partners can influence the genetic makeup of her future children is known as telegony. This theory suggests that traits from a woman's former mates could be inherited by offspring conceived with different partners. Historically, telegony was accepted in various cultures, including ancient Greece, where it was believed that offspring could inherit characteristics from a mother's previous mates. (en.wikipedia.org)\n\nHowever, modern genetics has thoroughly debunked this concept. Scientific research has demonstrated that a child's genetic material is exclusively derived from the DNA of their biological parents\u2014the mother and the father who contribute the egg and sperm, respectively. There is no mechanism by which the genetic material of a woman's previous partners can influence the DNA of her future offspring. (hiro-clinic.or.jp)\n\nIn summary, the idea that a woman's past sexual partners can affect the genetics of her future children is a myth. Modern scientific understanding confirms that offspring inherit genetic material solely from their biological parents, without any influence from previous mates.",

For that small group of guys, they're suddenly flooded with options. This abundance naturally makes any one woman seem more disposable and basically removes any need for them to be accountable for their actions. So, the very behaviors that women complain about being treated as disposable or just being used for sex, the same guy dating multiple women, are the predictable outcome of a dynamic where they are all competing for the same few men.",

You obviously haven't read very much in this subreddit, because the majority of pro-Israeli posters exhibit balanced views that acknowledge Palestinian suffering as well as Israeli wrongdoings.\n\nYou are \"tired\" of hearing about the Palestinian attitude towards Israel but that doesn't make it untrue. So that sounds like a personal problem to me. If the attitudes of Israelis and Palestinians are being discussed, it is valid and relevant to point out that a large majority of Palestinians do now and have in the past exhibited very hostile if not genocidal attitudes about Israel. If you don't want to hear that, don't participate in conversations about the topic.\n\nYour complaint about empathy is a common one but I ask the question, what do you expect people on a discussion forum to do about it? Should we all publicly comment about how bad we feel? Should we make threads where everyone replies, Oh yes it is so bad that children are suffering, Oh yes I feel terrible, This is so bad, I really feel terrible, Very tragic. What is the point of that? Please tell me. Everyone here already knows that war is terrible and that children suffering is terrible. Apparently there is some minimum of public gnashing of teeth via text on the internet is required for us to demonstrate that we care about children suffering? Should we have a paragraph long preface that we add to every single comment where we state how very regretful we are about suffering children? Now I am sure you will take this comment and say, Oh how callous of you, you are making light of suffering. But I am actually being genuine. What do you want us to do?\n\nAs to the rest, I will offer you my position which I consider pretty well balanced. Both Israelis and Palestinians have good reasons to hate each other, considering decades of conflict. Both groups of people surely have members with very negative attitudes towards the other, including the wish to see them all dead. The exact number of these people is unknown and will never be known, but they surely exist on both sides. I will add that this is true for basically any people in a conflict.\n\nThere has been military wrongdoing on each side, but the rate of war crimes is exponentially higher from Hamas than from Israel. Literally every military action that Hamas engages in is a war crime, due to not wearing uniforms to distinguish themselves from civilians, hiding amongst civilians, booby traps, etc. Whereas Israel military actions largely abide by the geneva conventions, with some instances surely violating those and therefore constituting war crimes. No one is perfect, and no war is conducted perfectly - war is inherently chaotic and there are bound to be war crimes, as well as accidents and mistakes resulting in casualties, which is a tragedy.\n\nAt the end of the day, women and children always suffer in war. This is common and obvious knowledge. Given that, it is incumbent upon people who value the lives of their women and children to avoid war. Gaza started this war against Israel, and the war isn't finished yet because Hamas is still fighting. So it isn't Israel's duty to stop fighting just because women and children are dying. It is the Gazans responsibility to come up with terms of surrender that Israel finds acceptable, if they want the suffering caused by them losing this war to stop. This is how war has always worked, and will likely always work in the future. If you don't like it, then you need to propose some kind of new framework that is acceptable to the winning party, because the winning party is the one that has the leverage to determine the terms of surrender. Otherwise, you're just crying into the void, perhaps hoping for some kind of validation for your feelings on the internet."

I think no one needs a background in psychology to say that Dahmer was clearly, profoundly mentally ill. But he wasn\u2019t unaware that his actions were wrong.  He understood the nature of his crimes, he just didn\u2019t care, because he enjoyed killing. \n\nOn the other end of the spectrum is Matthew Taylor Coleman, the father who killed his two young children because he\u2019d been sucked into bizarre conspiracy theories and sincerely believed that they would grow up to be monsters and that he had a duty to kill them. He took no enjoyment in it and gained no benefit from it, by all accounts he was grief-stricken over it - but he thought he had to, that it was the right thing to do.\n\nHe was found not competent to stand trial, last I heard.\n\nThat is legal insanity. \n\nThese are extreme examples, of course, but I think the average woman who aborts in the first trimester is much closer to Coleman than Dahmer in terms of culpability."

The best I\u2019ve come up with, if we are going to criminally charge women who abort, is to make trauma from rape an affirmative defense.\n\nI\u2019m much less interested in punishment than prevention in general, though, and I think when 1 in 5 pregnancies will be aborted we very clearly have a systemic problem.  I think the figure that 1 in 4 women will have an abortion by age 45 is probably exaggerated, but even if it\u2019s half that, that\u2019s not going to be fixed by punishing individual bad actors.\n\nAnd I also come back to the very basic principle that when a healthy animal destroys its own young, we can conclude that something is very wrong with the conditions in which it is living.

A study published in the Elsevier journal Personality and Individual Differences, conducted by a group of Polish scientists on 367 men and women, has found intriguing results concerning short men's behavior. The research, titled \"The Napoleon complex, revisited: Those high on the Dark Triad traits are dissatisfied with their height and are short,\" suggests that shorter men might compensate for their height with antagonistic behaviors, exhibiting traits known as the Dark Triad\u2014psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism.\n\nThese findings lend credence to the theory of the Napoleon complex, named after the relatively short French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, who was known for his aggressive leadership style. Shorter men exhibiting the Dark Triad traits might be embracing an adaptive strategy, making up for their perceived physical shortcomings with psychological assertiveness and ambition. Perhaps women subconsciously know that short men have a higher likelihood of having the so-called Napolean complex, or maybe they have experienced some unpleasant experiences in the past with shorter men.\n\nThe numbers might seem disheartening for shorter men, but they don't paint the full picture. Physical appearance is just one aspect of attraction, and what truly resonates with people is far more complex and nuanced. There are plenty of examples of women who have married men on the shorter side (or even men who are shorter than them) because they find them to be irresistibly charming. At the end of the day, men attract women because of their humor, success, and ability to protect and provide. There are plenty of men out there who are able to do all of these things regardless of their height. Couples like Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas, Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas, and Benji Madden and Cameron Diaz are some of the famous celebrity duos who defy the common statistics. Attraction and interest never boil exclusively down to looks, and men who know that and lead with other characteristics often have no problem dating in the real world."

I've found that the women around me tend to link \"attractive\" and \"confident\" together, or atleast the two qualities \"complete\" or \"complement\" each other.\n\nI remember while in university thinking \"I need to be more confident\" when presenting my ideas to the rest of the class or to other people but I found that people hated it. Almost like (and this is an internalization on my part) they thought \"Oh jeez you're ugly, you should be fitting the part and stay silent\" and I even had a girl rage at me in the cafeteria for that very reason. And yet, nowadays, I will talk about how no one outside of my family likes me very much and one thing they always say - especially online - is \"be more confident!\" I swear that has to be the oldest platitude in the book by now. You can pretty much go on autopilot with it while giving \"advice.\"\n\nBut, it's no secret that everyone likes the good-looking guy being overconfident. They will believe everything he says and give him all the attention in the world while at the same time those are the kinds of people we tend to warn against being too overconfident.\n\nI dunno. It all seems to go hand in hand. And hypocrisy isn't something I stomache very well. Maybe that is why I am so cynical now.",

The *vast* majority of women care about their partner's height and will not date men shorter than they are. And then a minority will not care, which naturally means that they're also willing to date men who are taller. And statistically speaking, the average man is taller than the average woman, so guess which is more likely to happen? Even women who \"prefer\" shorter men will still date taller men.

Lmao. I'm pointing out things that are *very observable*, you just disagree with them because it wasn't your experience.\n\n\n>And for the record, some of them _do_ prefer shorter men.

There are some behaviours that read as obnoxious even if that's not the intention. For example, I know a guy that knows when he's right, he's confident about it. No one likes him because it's always his priority to show how he's right and you're not. It's obnoxious.\n\n>if - for example - if someone doesn't like me then they get to say I'm \"not there\" yet.\n\nIf someone doesn't like you, you could be Henry Cavill himself, it wouldn't matter. Being confident only helps *before* you know someone in my experience. I know where you're going with this, but I don't think it applies. Most people probably don't dislike you because you're ugly. If that were the case, most ugly people would be alone and they are not. Such a social bias exists, and I can't know the extent of it, but many of the people I consider ugly live full social lives.\n\nWhen I was younger, I thought everyone hated me when they actually didn't. I was sure that people disliked me upon laying eyes on me and that I had 'something' fundamentally unlikable. Is it possible you're going through something similar?\n\n>what makes someone appealing isn't actually this notion of \"confidence\" but rather something else.\n\nYes, of course. It's not that confidence makes you appealing, it's that the lack of it makes you unappealing. For example, I'm fairly good looking, but since I had the confidence of a wet sock, when I was approached it didn't tend to last long UNLESS I was comfortable for whatever reason, which made me more confident.\n\nYou are not going to become desirable just because you're confident, but it helps to show people *you*. When people who love you tell you to be confident, they probably think you are worth showing. When people on Reddit say it, they are being parrots.\n\n>In the end it is all subjective; one thing that true confidence\u00a0*shouldn't*\u00a0be doing is making you think you know everything, because you really don't.\n\nTrue confidence is just not giving a crap, I think. That's why it's so hard to get or fake, because if you care about being confident, you aren't. When you care, you crave validatio and that becomes obnoxious, which is commonly lumped in with 'overconfidence'.\n\nSome people have other positive qualities that allow them to be obnoxious and still find success. They are not being rewarded for being obnoxious, but in spite of it. Their other qualities just cancel it out. Looks are a common example because you don't have to work through a person's personality to see them, unlike humor, kindness, etc; which take longer."

Especially if that intelligence comes with neurodivergency. \n\nOne of my reports is very smart, in many ways that I am not, but I also realize that my leadership is still essential. Initially, I took their being smart to mean they wouldn't need as much guidance and direction. Especially since they transferred from inventory control, my expectations for accuracy, due diligence, and thoroughness were fairly high. I erroneously thought their application of knowledge would be seamless in their current role, and that assumption ended up burning me several times. \n\nCommunication, follow through, and ability to flexible and adapt to other perspectives are the areas that I needed to focus on. They really struggle with answering the question asked instead of answering the question they think the person is getting at, and it constantly gets them into trouble. They don't even realize they are doing it. They also make assumptions and state them as fact instead of verifying their claims. They have a tendency to step outside of their scope, make decisions based on their limited perception, and fail to realize they need approval from me to ensure there is alignment with the bigger picture. \n\nFortunately, we have made great progress in these areas, where previous leaders honestly gave up because they interpreted these tendencies as the smart associate just being difficult and unable to grow. I'm neurodivergent myself, so I picked up on a lot of the hurdles that others didn't even realize we're there. While it has been frustrating, the experience gained is invaluable, and I feel like I am closer to my goal of their being fulfilled in their role. \n\nSimply put, just because they are extremely intelligent doesn't mean there isn't much to learn from you. Just because they're smart doesn't mean they will automatically make the right choices. Just because they know more about a process, an application, or a piece of equipment doesn't mean they dont need your insight. If anything, they will need your support more than you probably think. It also requires you to adapt to their learning style, personality, and perspective. The respect will come when they realize you care about their growth, rather than just assuming they can handle most things without support."
