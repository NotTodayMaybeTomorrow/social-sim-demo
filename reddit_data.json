    "title": "Gender inequality at the societal level is a balancing variable for the fact that women have inherent interpersonal value and men do not.",
    "content": "Pretty self explanatory, women have the specific social and societal place that they do in any human culture (this place varies) because of the imbalance of inherent value attributed at a genetic level and how the individuals of that culture deal with that imbalance. Gender wars are pretty dumb when you get right down to it. Any argument from either side is basically just individuals responding to assumed societal and interpersonal value, which, regardless of gender doesn\u2019t care about who you are as an individual. women have inherent value. Any complaint coming from the feminist community basically boils down to: \u201cI have inherent value as a female, and no inherent value as an individual and I\u2019m upset about the social and societal consequences of this fact playing out in this specific way etc.\u201d\nAny complaint coming from the male community basically boils down to \u201cno one gives a shit because I have no interpersonal or societal value as an individual and I\u2019m upset about the social and societal consequences of this fact playing out in this specific way etc. \u201d\n\nBoth sides should really just stfu and practice a little empathy, as both sides really just want to be assured of their value as an individual, and any hint of justification for the other side reads as a direct confrontation of their sense of value and self. Basically we ALL have it tough, and empathy is the answer, not the negative feedback loops we find on Reddit. Thanks for tuning in. ",

            "body": ">So how, then, can you really tell whether or not someone else is confident in themselves without being obnoxious, yourself?\n\nIt's not what you *are*, it's what you *come off as*. There are some behaviours that read as obnoxious even if that's not the intention. For example, I know a guy that knows when he's right, he's confident about it. No one likes him because it's always his priority to show how he's right and you're not. It's obnoxious.\n\n>if - for example - if someone doesn't like me then they get to say I'm \"not there\" yet.\n\nIf someone doesn't like you, you could be Henry Cavill himself, it wouldn't matter. Being confident only helps *before* you know someone in my experience. I know where you're going with this, but I don't think it applies. Most people probably don't dislike you because you're ugly. If that were the case, most ugly people would be alone and they are not. Such a social bias exists, and I can't know the extent of it, but many of the people I consider ugly live full social lives.\n\nWhen I was younger, I thought everyone hated me when they actually didn't. I was sure that people disliked me upon laying eyes on me and that I had 'something' fundamentally unlikable. Is it possible you're going through something similar?\n\n>what makes someone appealing isn't actually this notion of \"confidence\" but rather something else.\n\nYes, of course. It's not that confidence makes you appealing, it's that the lack of it makes you unappealing. For example, I'm fairly good looking, but since I had the confidence of a wet sock, when I was approached it didn't tend to last long UNLESS I was comfortable for whatever reason, which made me more confident.\n\nYou are not going to become desirable just because you're confident, but it helps to show people *you*. When people who love you tell you to be confident, they probably think you are worth showing. When people on Reddit say it, they are being parrots.\n\n>In the end it is all subjective; one thing that true confidence\u00a0*shouldn't*\u00a0be doing is making you think you know everything, because you really don't.\n\nTrue confidence is just not giving a crap, I think. That's why it's so hard to get or fake, because if you care about being confident, you aren't. When you care, you crave validatio and that becomes obnoxious, which is commonly lumped in with 'overconfidence'.\n\nSome people have other positive qualities that allow them to be obnoxious and still find success. They are not being rewarded for being obnoxious, but in spite of it. Their other qualities just cancel it out. Looks are a common example because you don't have to work through a person's personality to see them, unlike humor, kindness, etc; which take longer."

People often use that phrase to justify what they want in a partner or to shame behavior they don\u2019t like. For example, someone might say \u201ca real man pays for everything\u201d or \u201ca real man never judges my sexual history\u201d \u2014 but those are just projections of personal expectations, or insecurities. It's not an objective definition of manhood.\n\nWe all know some men don't like dating single moms, promiscuous people, S workers, high body count holders or anything along those lines. They claim that a real man accepts this or what when in reality most self respecting men don't. They try to shame the standards men have. I'm sure some men don't mind, that's ok but majority I see it's people say a real man this is to avoid accountability or justify not wanting certain traits in a partner as shaming, instead of admitting their own issues they try to avoid the fact that most men don't want a person like them and if a guy doesn't then he\u2019s \u201cless of a man.\u201d In reality, being a \u201creal man\u201d isn\u2019t somehting that can be shifted to your own narrative.\n\n\nIt becomes a tool of control, manipulation and validation.",

Some people just can't contribute to sociey, and society's abrupt judgement as \"low worth\" causes them to withdraw. Classic Catch-22.\n\nAlso, I'd be careful where you go with that \"resources\" response. Let's me simply say that in the last century, that led to some  [extreme](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/euthanasia-program) [outcomes](https://www.npr.org/2011/12/28/144375339/a-brutal-chapter-in-north-carolinas-eugenics-past) .\n\nNobody should be allowed to live that way? At this point, I'll just say \"Who made YOU God\".\n\nIt's obvious you are drive more than basebrain personal distaste, not the rational thought process. The only reason incels and others you mentioned are bad is because your impulses and society says so. Neither are any longer a practical basis for sizing up one's worth - if they ever were ones."

There are some behaviours that read as obnoxious even if that's not the intention. For example, I know a guy that knows when he's right, he's confident about it. No one likes him because it's always his priority to show how he's right and you're not. It's obnoxious.\n\n>if - for example - if someone doesn't like me then they get to say I'm \"not there\" yet.\n\nIf someone doesn't like you, you could be Henry Cavill himself, it wouldn't matter. Being confident only helps *before* you know someone in my experience. I know where you're going with this, but I don't think it applies. Most people probably don't dislike you because you're ugly. If that were the case, most ugly people would be alone and they are not. Such a social bias exists, and I can't know the extent of it, but many of the people I consider ugly live full social lives.\n\nWhen I was younger, I thought everyone hated me when they actually didn't. I was sure that people disliked me upon laying eyes on me and that I had 'something' fundamentally unlikable. Is it possible you're going through something similar?\n\n>what makes someone appealing isn't actually this notion of \"confidence\" but rather something else.\n\nYes, of course. It's not that confidence makes you appealing, it's that the lack of it makes you unappealing. For example, I'm fairly good looking, but since I had the confidence of a wet sock, when I was approached it didn't tend to last long UNLESS I was comfortable for whatever reason, which made me more confident.\n\nYou are not going to become desirable just because you're confident, but it helps to show people *you*. When people who love you tell you to be confident, they probably think you are worth showing. When people on Reddit say it, they are being parrots.\n\n>In the end it is all subjective; one thing that true confidence\u00a0*shouldn't*\u00a0be doing is making you think you know everything, because you really don't.\n\nTrue confidence is just not giving a crap, I think. That's why it's so hard to get or fake, because if you care about being confident, you aren't. When you care, you crave validatio and that becomes obnoxious, which is commonly lumped in with 'overconfidence'.\n\nSome people have other positive qualities that allow them to be obnoxious and still find success. They are not being rewarded for being obnoxious, but in spite of it. Their other qualities just cancel it out. Looks are a common example because you don't have to work through a person's personality to see them, unlike humor, kindness, etc; which take longer."

This abundance naturally makes any one woman seem more disposable and basically removes any need for them to be accountable for their actions. So, the very behaviors that women complain about being treated as disposable or just being used for sex, the same guy dating multiple women, are the predictable outcome of a dynamic where they are all competing for the same few men.",

You obviously haven't read very much in this subreddit, because the majority of pro-Israeli posters exhibit balanced views that acknowledge Palestinian suffering as well as Israeli wrongdoings.\n\nYou are \"tired\" of hearing about the Palestinian attitude towards Israel but that doesn't make it untrue. So that sounds like a personal problem to me. If the attitudes of Israelis and Palestinians are being discussed, it is valid and relevant to point out that a large majority of Palestinians do now and have in the past exhibited very hostile if not genocidal attitudes about Israel. If you don't want to hear that, don't participate in conversations about the topic.\n\nYour complaint about empathy is a common one but I ask the question, what do you expect people on a discussion forum to do about it? Should we all publicly comment about how bad we feel? Should we make threads where everyone replies, Oh yes it is so bad that children are suffering, Oh yes I feel terrible, This is so bad, I really feel terrible, Very tragic. What is the point of that? Please tell me. Everyone here already knows that war is terrible and that children suffering is terrible. Apparently there is some minimum of public gnashing of teeth via text on the internet is required for us to demonstrate that we care about children suffering? Should we have a paragraph long preface that we add to every single comment where we state how very regretful we are about suffering children? Now I am sure you will take this comment and say, Oh how callous of you, you are making light of suffering. But I am actually being genuine. What do you want us to do?\n\nAs to the rest, I will offer you my position which I consider pretty well balanced. Both Israelis and Palestinians have good reasons to hate each other, considering decades of conflict. Both groups of people surely have members with very negative attitudes towards the other, including the wish to see them all dead. The exact number of these people is unknown and will never be known, but they surely exist on both sides. I will add that this is true for basically any people in a conflict.\n\nThere has been military wrongdoing on each side, but the rate of war crimes is exponentially higher from Hamas than from Israel. Literally every military action that Hamas engages in is a war crime, due to not wearing uniforms to distinguish themselves from civilians, hiding amongst civilians, booby traps, etc. Whereas Israel military actions largely abide by the geneva conventions, with some instances surely violating those and therefore constituting war crimes. No one is perfect, and no war is conducted perfectly - war is inherently chaotic and there are bound to be war crimes, as well as accidents and mistakes resulting in casualties, which is a tragedy.\n\nAt the end of the day, women and children always suffer in war. This is common and obvious knowledge. Given that, it is incumbent upon people who value the lives of their women and children to avoid war. Gaza started this war against Israel, and the war isn't finished yet because Hamas is still fighting. So it isn't Israel's duty to stop fighting just because women and children are dying. It is the Gazans responsibility to come up with terms of surrender that Israel finds acceptable, if they want the suffering caused by them losing this war to stop. This is how war has always worked, and will likely always work in the future. If you don't like it, then you need to propose some kind of new framework that is acceptable to the winning party, because the winning party is the one that has the leverage to determine the terms of surrender. Otherwise, you're just crying into the void, perhaps hoping for some kind of validation for your feelings on the internet."

A study published in the Elsevier journal Personality and Individual Differences, conducted by a group of Polish scientists on 367 men and women, has found intriguing results concerning short men's behavior. The research, titled \"The Napoleon complex, revisited: Those high on the Dark Triad traits are dissatisfied with their height and are short,\" suggests that shorter men might compensate for their height with antagonistic behaviors, exhibiting traits known as the Dark Triad\u2014psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism.\n\nThese findings lend credence to the theory of the Napoleon complex, named after the relatively short French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, who was known for his aggressive leadership style. Shorter men exhibiting the Dark Triad traits might be embracing an adaptive strategy, making up for their perceived physical shortcomings with psychological assertiveness and ambition. Perhaps women subconsciously know that short men have a higher likelihood of having the so-called Napolean complex, or maybe they have experienced some unpleasant experiences in the past with shorter men.\n\nThe numbers might seem disheartening for shorter men, but they don't paint the full picture. Physical appearance is just one aspect of attraction, and what truly resonates with people is far more complex and nuanced. There are plenty of examples of women who have married men on the shorter side (or even men who are shorter than them) because they find them to be irresistibly charming. At the end of the day, men attract women because of their humor, success, and ability to protect and provide. There are plenty of men out there who are able to do all of these things regardless of their height. Couples like Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas, Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas, and Benji Madden and Cameron Diaz are some of the famous celebrity duos who defy the common statistics. Attraction and interest never boil exclusively down to looks, and men who know that and lead with other characteristics often have no problem dating in the real world."

That is far later in the pregnancy.\n\nThe issue, even by your description, has nothing to do with a woman \"having plenty of time\" to choose.\n\nThe right to bodily autonomy is indeed a right.  Women should not be forced to host a fetus if they do not want it.  If we're going to speak in terms of personhood, a person has rights, and a fetus does not.  Otherwise, it makes no sense to draw a line.  The rest of your thesis seems to agree.\n\nThe \"vast majority\" of pregnancies are *not* planned.  The estimate for unplanned pregnancies is around 46%, and this data is entirely self reported.  Even if we assume 100% accuracy, 54% is not a \"vast\" majority.\n\nAssuming that a fetus in question is a person, you are correct in that abortion involves two people.  Even past the age of personhood, a woman's right to control her body does not outweigh a fetal person's interests.  At best, these are equal.\n\nTake the example of a situation where one person needs a kidney, and the second person does not want to give up a kidney.  Does this mean that the first be able to forcibly harvest a kidney from the second?  I would argue that it does not.  Consider also that the fetal person from your example requires decades of care from the mother, and I think it's clear that a fetus' interests do not outweigh a woman's bodily autonomy at any age."

You will likely want to give yourself some time alone, though.\n\nTake some time to savor being single.  As the smoke clears, you will find yourself able to do hundreds of little things that you stopped doing, due to her preferences.  You can live entirely on your own schedule, eat foods that she didn't enjoy, and pursue hobbies that she wasn't interested in.

If however one talks to poor workers about how their fears of losing their income are justified but it\u2019s not because of immigrants, but because wealthy CEOs are hoarding wealth and other problems related to capitalism then that would be a way to appeal to poor white workers without going against leftist values."

I think one problem with using privileged group language is that even if one says that a person can be privileged in one way and marginalized in others is that it puts the emphasis more on the advantages one group than the struggles of another, when I think hearing stories about the struggles of one group tends to help more with fostering empathy and compassion more than talking about the advantages of the other.\n\nAs one example I think if I hear about how someone is severely abused by their parents then that\u2019s a lot more effective at getting me to empathize with them and look for possible ways to address child abuse than if I\u2019m just told that I didn\u2019t have to deal with child abuse growing up.  I think the latter can come off as more making assumptions about my situation even if it still acknowledges that I may have other struggles.\n\nI think in general it\u2019s more important to acknowledge the struggles of a marginalized group than to acknowledge the advantages of a privileged group because I think that\u2019s more important for having systemic change for the better.  For instance when it comes to making things more equal it\u2019s often more about trying to make things better for a marginalized group, such as fighting police brutality towards African Americans, whether than making things less optimal for the privileged group."

I tend to know how people interpret things mainly from noticing patterns whether than from necessarily interpreting things in the same way.\n\nI think part of my confusion comes from how people will sometimes give reasons for someone doing something when trying to find motives that indicate that they did it, or if someone is trying to explain to another person why they shouldn\u2019t do something then they will tend to interpret reasons for why they are doing the something.

For instance for me saying someone is making excuses could imply that the person is believed to be trying to escape consequences or it could mean that the person is believed to be unwilling to change.  Saying that someone is making excuses however doesn\u2019t directly say either and I don\u2019t really like trying to read things into words.  Also if someone says that I\u2019m trying to use something as an excuse my most natural response is to just say that I\u2019m not.  I think for this reason I think I prefer terms that might meaning the same thing as making excuses but which are less confusing and more specific, such as \u201cWhat you say makes me think you aren\u2019t willing to try to improve yourself for this reason,\u201d or \u201cWhat you said makes me think you want to avoid consequences for this reason.\u201d  I think the terms I suggested are also easier to respond to and give me more insight on what the other person wants than just saying that I\u2019m making excuses.\n\nAlso I think generally the main reason I would try to over explain things is that often times it feels like people have in my past made negative assumptions that they held against me and often over explaining can be a way to try to leave less room for assumptions to try to minimize the chances of someone reading stuff into what I do.    I think also for me over explaining is often also something I do to try to express a desire to try to change even though a lot of people think of it as indicating the opposite, because for me if something is caused by something else it indicates that it\u2019s not a behavior that one wants to engage in compared to if it\u2019s done for no reason."

    "content": "\nThe facts are, there have been cases of women throughout history either living as men, or doing what was considered physically impossible for a woman. And it's not \"woke\" to acknowledge this or portray this in media. \n\nHistorically we have Mary Read who lived as a man for a large portion of her life even joining the British Navy without being discovered. \n\nWe also have Deborah Sampson of the American Revolution who may or may not have inspired a portion of Disney's Mulan. She disguised herself as a man to fight in the revolution and was only discovered upon being severely injured by the doctor treating her. She was given an honorable discharged after the same doctor vouched for her bravery. \n\nAnd though she didn't disguise herself as a man, we also have Virginia Hall, a one legged American spy amputee in WWII that was able to walk up to 50 miles in a day in rugged snow covered terrain  through the snow covered Pyrenees to escape capture while her wooden prosthetic bit into her flesh. \n\nIt's interesting to note that the official National Archives of the UK website (Virginia was working for British intelligence during this time) lists her as walking up to 50 miles a day. But a lot of American sources (again she wasn't working with them at the time) often list her as traveling 50 miles over the course of 2-3 days. That's a massive difference. (Just to make you wonder)\n\nAnd those are just a few examples. \n\nSo why is it completely abnormal to think that in today's day and age of knowledge of proper nutrition and modern healthcare, that *some* women can also just be more broader or more muscular than the average gal and even when not can also do what is considered impossible by most? \n\nIt's not abnormal at all. People are just afraid of the simple fact that some women can compete with the average man physically. ",
