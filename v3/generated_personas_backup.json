I'd gone outside at 11pm. A show was on TV streaming, 20 minute episodes, no ads, a series I've seen countless times before.  So when I got back inside, the next episode was just starting, which aligned with my approximate 20 minute estimate of time outside.  But all the clocks (analog, digital, battery run, as well as plugged in, every clock, even my cell phone), suddenly showed it was past 1pm. Over 2 hours had gone by. But only the one 20 minute show had played on TV. My kids were inside and confirmed the TV never paused or shut off the show. So somehow over 2 hours had passed, while I smoked one cigarette and while only one 20 minute TV show had played.  I'd even told the kids before i went out, that it was 11pm, getting late, they'd have to go to bed when I got back in. None of us could figure out how over 2 hours has gone by. I'd normally NEVER let my kids stay up past 1am, even on summer non-school nights. I'd forgotten about it till I just read your post. Spooky stuff...",

But we weren't checking our phones because we were talking, listening to music and just not paying attention to the time. Anyway, the person we were going to see finally texts and is like... I thought you said you were on the way??? We were supposed to be there by about 1, and it was now 4:30... We have no idea what happened. We didn't turn off anywhere, we didn't stop anywhere else, we didn't get stuck in traffic. And on the way back, it took about 40 minutes exactly. So fucking weird"

One of them even claimed to walk into an old-fashioned shop and interact with people before snapping back to present day.

He even described the interior in stunning detail.\n\nJust like your experience, there was no portal or beam of light\u2014just a subtle but inexplicable moment where the rules of time and space didn\u2019t seem to apply. The fact that you recognized one of the people as your dad\u2019s younger self and only confirmed it later through photo hits the same eerie note.\n\nMaybe these glitches are less full-on time travel and more like overlaps in the simulation\u2014brief moments where time folds or data crosswires.

And now it\u2019s troubling you, but the moment has passed. Just know that it was meant to happen exactly the way it did. You couldn\u2019t have changed it.\n\nMaybe your life is in some kind of loop and this is something that keeps repeating across lifetimes .. or maybe not. Perhaps it was a one-off glitch, something that wasn\u2019t supposed to happen but did anyway. In a strange way, maybe it\u2019s a good thing that you and your younger self didn\u2019t actually meet or touch. That might have really messed things up.\n\nI wanted to ask though.. do you live in the same house now as you did when you were younger? If you\u2019ve moved, maybe your younger self is living in that original place. You could try watching him from afar to see if everything else matches up. I wouldn\u2019t usually advise this, but since this is really affecting you, it might offer some clarity.\n\nJust be careful not to meet him or let him see you. That could create a paradox and you don\u2019t want to risk things spiraling out of control.",
